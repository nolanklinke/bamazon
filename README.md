# Bamazon

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to show the functionality of database storage using a combination of Node.js & MySQL. This app displays a "store front" through the console and accepts user input to take orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

## bamazonCustomer.js
Running this app first displays all items available for sale. Inquirer is utilized to ask the user which item and how many of that item they would like to purchase. 

If the quantity request is available, the user will "recieve" that number of the item, and the products table will be updated within the bamazon database. 

If the quantity request of that item is more than what is available, the user will be met with an error.
